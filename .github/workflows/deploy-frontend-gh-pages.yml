name: Deploy Frontend to GitHub Pages (disabled)

# This workflow was disabled from running on push because it used an older
# deployment approach (peaceiris/actions-gh-pages) that can pull in a
# deprecated dependency. The repository now uses `.github/workflows/deploy-frontend.yml`
# which leverages the official Pages Actions. Keep this file for reference only.
